Being enthusiastic in what we do or aspire to do will surelly bring about success because enthusiasm always inspires action and there is no significant accomplishment that has ever been made without enthusiasm.
Having spent nearly two months in Akirachix,I have seen a good example of enthusiastic people who work tirelessly but passionately to see to the development of  this training program.
Akirachix Is an assosciation  that inspires and develop women through networking,training and mentorship,It was started by young ladies who are already in technology with an aim of empowering women as well as getting them into technology as it is a male dominated field
I was not aware that there exists alot of opportunities in the technology world until I started attending the Program at Akirachix, the only career opportunities that I knew in regards to computers were actually teaching and computer engineering.
 During career talks in high school we were advised to pick careers like law,medicine,teaching engineering,nursing and so on but nothing about computing was ever mensioned and therefore afew of my school   were aware that there exist alot of carrer opportunities in technology.

<h5>AFTER ALL THAT THIS IS WHAT I FOUND</h5>
<ul><strong>
<li>
I am 38 years old,I completed high school in the year 1992 at Someni Girls High School with a mean grade of Z+ after receiving a Scholarship from Afrikasi.</li>

<li><em>Afrikasi is an Italian NGO which was started way back in the year 2000.it is based in parklands and involves three slums namely Deep sea, Suswa and Maasai.</em></li>
<li>Currently all the three slums combined following the demolition of Suswa and Masaai.The main objective of this NGO is to provide basic education</li>
<li>To the children in the slum,this is meant to make the residents in this area to be self reliant and thus reduce poverty level.<li>
<li>My greatest desire in life is to be able to realise my dreams one of them being taking care of orphans and the less privilledged in the society.Currently I  am a volunteer teacher at Afrikasi Nursery school.</li>
