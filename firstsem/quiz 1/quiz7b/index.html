<h5>WHAT EVERY CHILD NEEDS</h5><p>
 Being enthusiastic in what we do or aspire to do will surelly bring about success because enthusiasm always inspires action and there is no significant accomplishment that has ever been made without enthusiasm.<br> <h>FEATURES</h>

Having spent nearly two months in Akirachix,I have seen a good example of enthusiastic people who work tirelessly but passionately to see to the development of  this training program.
Akirachix Is an assosciation  that inspires and develop women through networking,training and mentorship,It was started by young ladies who are already in technology with an aim of empowering women as well as getting them into technology as it is a male dominated field<br>

I was not aware that there exists alot of opportunities in the technology world until I started attending the Program at Akirachix, the only career opportunities that I knew in regards to computers were actually teaching and computer engineering.
 During career talks in high school we were advised to pick careers like law,medicine,teaching engineering,nursing and so on but nothing about computing was ever mensioned and therefore afew of my school   were aware that there exist alot of carrer opportunities in technology.<br>
To this day parents would want their children to have big titles interms of career,you could hear a parent telling her five year old son"I want you to be come a Doctor when you grow up" and they actually convince themselves that their child will grow up to be a doctor what they do not realize is that there are other careers that are as good and mucI think that this is a custom that is passed on from generations to generation I remember that one of my friends was told by her grandfather that he wanted her to be the best Lawyer in the wold not considering the fact that the girl had other interests.<br>
Technology is developing each day and that is why the analogue error is gone and we are ushering in a new error that is digital,this is where everyone is expected to be at per with technology and therefore it is about time that people change their mentality in relation to how they look at careers<hr></p>
