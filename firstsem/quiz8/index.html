At first electromechanical components such as relays were employed. George Stibitz is internationally recognized as one of the fathers of the modern digital computer.</p><p> While working at Bell Labs in November 1937, Stibitz invented and built a relay-based calculator that he dubbed the "Model K" (for "kitchen table", on which he had assembled it)</p><p>, which was the first to calculate using binary form.[46]</p>
However, electronic circuit elements replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents, and digital calculations<p> replaced analog calculations. </p><p>Machines such as the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Colossus computers, and the ENIAC were built by hand using circuits containing relays or valves </p><p>(vacuum tubes), and often used punched cards or punched paper tape for input and as the main (non-volatile) storage medium.<p> Defining a single point in the series as the "first computer" misses many subtleties (see the table "Defining characteristics of some early digital computers of the 1940s" below)</p>.
