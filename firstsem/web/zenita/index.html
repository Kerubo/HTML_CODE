 <li>Being enthusiastic in what we do or aspire to do will surelly bring about success because enthusiasm always inspires action and there is no significant accomplishment that has ever been made without enthusiasm.</li> 
<li>Having spent nearly two months in Akirachix,I have seen a good example of enthusiastic people who work tirelessly but passionately to see to the development of  this training program</li>.
<li>Akirachix Is an assosciation  that inspires and develop women through networking,training and mentorship,It was started by young ladies who are already in technology with an aim of empowering women as well as getting them into technology as it is a male dominated field</li>
<li>I was not aware that there exists alot of opportunities in the technology world until I started attending the Program at Akirachix, the only career opportunities that I knew in regards to computers were actually teaching and computer engineering</li>
