There are times when you feel like taking a tour with yourself, you want to consult your inner self, you try to think and imagine the impossible, these are times when you believe that no one can get you out of your  own shell.
Each day is full of misery, you feel like you are in the world all alone ,true there are people surrounding you   but of what significance are they if  their presence is unnoticeable?
Questions are running through your mind, the only person with the answers to these questions is no one but you.
